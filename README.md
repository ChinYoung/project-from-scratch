### Phase 1, Initiate a project

- At this stage, we will create a project from blank

#### Goal: get familiar with the usage of such tools

- git(github/gitlab)
- npm
- webpack
- babel
- eslint
- We will also involve some knowledge of the framework which we will use next.

#### Expected output: a npm project with such feature

- With the command "serve", the project should start a dev-server
- A top framework(vue/react/angular) should be included
- A unit test framework should be included
- The server serves a html page rendered by the framework, the page should display "Hello world"
- The server should has the feature as "hot-reload"
- Eslint should be included and should be well-configured as well
- Able to switch and use different parameter settings by environment parameter(development/test/production)
- A "build" command to build and generate artifacts for deployment
- A "test" command to run unit tests of the project
- A "lint" command to run a eslint check
- Any other feature as you like
